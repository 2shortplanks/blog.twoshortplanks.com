<p>You're reading Mark Fowler's Perl blog where he whitters about Perl programming.</p>
<p>Mark is a professional Perl programmer working in London, United Kindom.  He's been programming Perl for over ten years, in which time he's been involved in various hijinks like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~markf/">releasing open source modules</a>, heading up the <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London Perl Moungers</a> user group for a while, organising the odd Perl conference here and there, and starting the Perl advent calendar.</p>
<p><a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/"><img style="float:left;margin:5px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Trelane.png" /></a> After several years hiatus from keeping a Perl blog he recently decided to start blogging again as part of a the <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">Perl Ironman Challenge</a>, where he agreed to post on average once a week in exchange for the right to show this natty icon on this page.</p>
