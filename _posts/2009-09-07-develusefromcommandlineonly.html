<p>On Friday I <a href="http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2009/09/04/testenhancedis/">posted</a> a horrible chunk of code to my blog.  With all the scorn I threw about it there's one bit I didn't cover however, a sort of saving grace.  The second line here:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>package Test::EnhancedIs;
use base qw(Devel::UseFromCommandLineOnly);</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Devel::UseFromCommandLineOnly?  What the heck is that, and why am I subclassing it?  Well, that, boys and girls, is another quick module I knocked up while butchering the internals of Test::Builder.</p>
<p>You see, I wrote Test::EnhancedIs as a proof of concept that I knew would very likely break just as soon as someone changed Test::Builder in the slightest.  I'm offering it as unsupported experimental code, but even I know no sooner had I typed those warning words that someone else was busy typing</p>
<p><code>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;
use Test::EnhancedIs;  # whooo, easier tests

use Sharks;
is(Sharks-&gt;armed,"frickin' laser beams");</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>And committing it to their version control system.  I know what'll happen next is that that person or their coworkers, months down the line when this inevitably breaks, will hunt me or the hardworking geniuses that maintain Test::Builder down to blame us for <i>breaking their code</i>.</p>
<p>So I decided to not let that happen.  If you run the above code it outputs:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>bash$ perl test.t
1..1
Invalid use of Test::EnhancedIs in 'test.t' at line 7; This module can only be loaded from the command line at test.t line 7</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Yep, that's Devel::UseFromTheCommandLineOnly kicking in and hitting you with the cluestick.  However, if you remove line 7 from the above example and run the test loading the extra module from the command line like so:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>travis-4:~ mark$ perl -MTest::EnhancedIs test.t 
1..1
not ok 1
#   Failed test at test.t line 9.
#          got: 'frickin' <span style="color:white;background:red;">*</span>sharp teeth'
#     expected: 'frickin' <span style="color:white;background:red;">*</span>laser beams'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Everything is dandy.</p>
<p>Devel::UserFromCommandLineOnly is on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-UseFromCommandLineOnly/">CPAN</a> and <a href="http://github.com/2shortplanks/devel-usefromcommandlineonly">GitHub</a> if you want to play with it.</p>
