title: Having a Brew
---
Back in <a href="http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2009/08/12/testing-perl-5-10-1-rc-1/">August in 2009</a> I wrote a post on how to install a release candidate of Perl.  Installing a custom perl in your home directory has since got a lot easier with perlbrew, and in this blog post I'll show the five commands needed to get a new perl onto your system.

<h2>A new perl in five commands</h2>

<p>First I need to setup perlbrew.
This takes three commands (the latter two will be different on your system, but don&#039;t worry, in each case the previous command tells you what to do when you run it.)</p>

<pre>   curl -L http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash
   /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew init
   echo &#062;&#062;~/.bashrc &#034;source /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc&#034;</pre>

<p>Now to install and switch to the latest development version of perl I only need type:</p>

<pre>   perlbrew install perl-5.13.8
   perlbrew switch perl-5.13.8</pre>

<p>And to install and switch to the latest stable perl I only need to type:</p>

<pre>   perlbrew install perl-5.12.2
   perlbrew switch perl-5.12.2</pre>

<h2>Again, in excruciating detail</h2>

<p>If you&#039;re anything like me, you&#039;ve seen this kind of quickfire instructions on the web before and it leaves you with questions. Wouldn&#039;t it be nice if someone posted a complete dump of exactly what was going on when these commands are run? Yes, it would be...</p>

<p>Let&#039;s start from the top again. First, download and install perlbrew with the one liner:</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ curl -L http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash</pre>

<p>Off it goes:</p>

<pre>    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  102   306  102   306    0     0    236      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--  2756

  ## Download the latest perlbrew

  ## Installing
  The perlbrew is installed as:

      /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew

  You may trash the downloaded /private/tmp/perlbrew from now on.

  Next, if this is the first time you install perlbrew, run:

      /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew init

  And follow the instruction on screen.

  ## Done. (automatically removes downloaded /tmp/perlbrew)</pre>

<p>We&#039;d better follow its instructions, eh?</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew init</pre>

<p>This prints out some more stuff, including an instruction to modify our path:</p>

<pre>  Perlbrew environment initiated, required directories are created under

      /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew

  Well-done! Congratulations! Please add the following line to the end
  of your ~/.bashrc

      source /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc

  After that, exit this shell, start a new one, and install some fresh
  perls:

      perlbrew install perl-5.12.1
      perlbrew install perl-5.10.1

  For further instructions, simply run:

      perlbrew

  The default help messages will popup and tell you what to do!

  Enjoy perlbrew at $HOME!!</pre>

<p>Okay, let&#039;s modify our path to contain the instructions then:</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ echo &#062;&#062;~/.bashrc &#034;source /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc&#034;</pre>

<p>Now we need to restart bash. The easiest way to do that is to close the current terminal and open a new one (and stops us getting confused.) After this, installing a new Perl is a doddle, with just a single command.</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ perlbrew install perl-5.13.8</pre>

<p>And it does all the hard work for us:</p>

<pre>  Attempting to load conf from /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/Conf.pm
  Fetching perl-5.13.8 as /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/dists/perl-5.13.8.tar.gz
  Installing perl-5.13.8 into /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.13.8
  This could take a while. You can run the following command on another shell to track the status:

    tail -f /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/build.log

  (cd /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/build; tar xzf /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/dists/perl-5.13.8.tar.gz;cd /Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/build/perl-5.13.8;rm -f config.sh Policy.sh;sh Configure -de &#039;-Dprefix=/Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.13.8&#039; &#039;-Dusedevel&#039;;make;make test &#038;&#038; make install) &#062;&#062; &#039;/Users/mark/perl5/perlbrew/build.log&#039; 2&#062;&#038;1 
  Installed perl-5.13.8 as perl-5.13.8 successfully. Run the following command to switch to it.

    perlbrew switch perl-5.13.8</pre>

<p>So, as it says, we can switch which perl we&#039;re using just by using the &#034;perlbrew switch&#034; command:</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ perl -v

  This is perl, v5.10.0 built for darwin-thread-multi-2level
  (with 2 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

<p>We can switch back to the system perl with the &#034;perlbrew off&#034; command:</p>

<pre>  travis-4:~ mark$ perlbrew off
  travis-4:~ mark$ perl -v

  This is perl, v5.10.0 built for darwin-thread-multi-2level

<p>And that&#039;s about it. Very simple!</p>
