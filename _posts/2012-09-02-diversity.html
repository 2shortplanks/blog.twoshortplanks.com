<p>One of the advantages of working from home is that I can do more interesting&nbsp;things with my lunch break that simply eat lunch. So, every week for three&nbsp;years I took my daughters to a local sing-a-long group.</p>
<p>Now as you can imagine, this group was primarily made up of mothers and their&nbsp;children. The people who run the sessions are women. On the odd occasion&nbsp;another father would turn up, but it was mostly just me and thirty&nbsp;women and their children.</p>
<p>No-one ever implied that I shouldn't be there. No-one ever made jokes about men&nbsp;being useless. People didn't try to have "Cosmo" type conversations with me&nbsp;that would make me blush. No-one even made any comment implying it was un-manly&nbsp;for me to sing along with nursery rhymes like all the other parents did.</p>
<p>All in all you could say it was great. I'd never accuse anyone at any of these&nbsp;events of being sexist.</p>
<p>But then again, every so often the group would sing a song about Bobby Shaftoe.&nbsp;For those of you not familar the lyrics go:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Bobby Shaftoe went to sea,<br />
Silver buckles on his knee.<br />
He'll come back and marry me,<br />
Pretty Bobby Shaftoe.</p>
<p>I never - in three years - spoke up about how uncomfortable these lyrics are for&nbsp;a straight man to sing. In the end I just stopped singing them.</p>
<p>Did this really bother me that much? Not really, otherwise I would have said&nbsp;something. But it let me experience in the tiniest possible little way what it's&nbsp;like to be suddenly reminded that you're different to everyone else in the&nbsp;group and to find out that you can't join in what everyone else is doing&nbsp;because it's not designed for you.</p>
<p>So, with this in mind I wish that people would understand that when I'm&nbsp;suggesting a code of conduct for a tech community my primary objective is not to&nbsp;suggest a list of things you can and can't do. Nor am I suggesting that people&nbsp;are deliberately being nasty. I'm just trying to encourage everyone to think a&nbsp;little wider about the other people in their community that aren't just like&nbsp;them - because even the best of us sometimes can have a blind spot. You know,&nbsp;it's not always about the big things.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just don't want community member to have to sing songs about their&nbsp;desire to marry a sailorman. And if they do find themselves in a situation&nbsp;where someone is asking them to declare their desire for silver buckled knee&nbsp;wearers that they feel like they can politely point out that they shouldn't have&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
