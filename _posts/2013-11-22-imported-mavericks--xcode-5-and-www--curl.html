title: 'Mavericks, XCode 5 and WWW::Curl'
---
Sometimes you go through a lot of pain trying to get something to work, and you just need to write it down and put it on the internet.  You tell yourself this is useful;  You're doing it so that others can find your words and solve the problem too.  In reality, it's just cathartic.  And who doesn't like a good rant?

<h2>So What Broke?</h2>

I recently updated my Mac to Mavericks (OS X 10.9).  Overall, I like it...but it broke something I care about. It broke <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2013-10/0036.html">libcurl's handling of certificates.</a>, and in so doing broke my install of WWW::Curl also (since it's a wrapper around the system libcurl.)  This is remarkably hard to diagnose, because it just seems like the servers have suddenly stopped trusting each other (when in reality libcurl has just started effectively ignoring the options you're passing to it.)

Now, WWW::Curl (and its working certificate handling) is a dependency of some of the code I'm using.  Worse than forcing me to disable certificate security, I actually need to identify myself to the server with my own cert.  Just turning them off and running insecurely <em>won't</em> <em>work</em>.

<h2>Installing libcurl</h2>

I'm not a great fan of installing software from source on my mac after having been bitten by fink and it's kin numerous times in the past.  This said, <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> is actually pretty darn nifty, and can be used to install libcurl:

<pre><code>brew install curl   
</code></pre>

Wrrr, clunk, clunk and zap, I have a non broken <code>curl</code> in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/gcc47/4.7.3/bin</code>.  Hooray!  This one actually deems to listen to the command line options you pass it!

<h2>Installing WWW::Curl</h2>

Now all we have to do is install WWW::Curl and link it against this libcurl, right?  Well, I did this:

<pre><code>wget http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/S/SZ/SZBALINT/WWW-Curl-4.15.tar.gz
gunzip -c WWW-Curl-4.15.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
cd WWW-Curl-4.15
export CURL_CONFIG=/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.33.0/bin/curl-config
perl Makefile.PL
</code></pre>

And things started to go wrong:

<pre><code>The version is libcurl 7.33.0

That Ladies and Gentlemen is the sound of Apple's compiler sucking.  You see, not so long ago I upgraded to XCode 5 and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_5_0.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012953-SW28">apparently this no longer ships with gcc</a>.  Uh oh.

(I don't show the errors you get when you <code>make</code> and <code>make test</code>, but be assured it's all downhill from here)

<h3>Installing gcc</h3>

I suspect I could have just re-downloaded XCode 4 and then used <code>xcode-select</code>.  But I didn't.  Let me know if that works, okay?  This is what I actually did:

<pre><code>brew install gcc47
</code></pre>

Then I waited a long time (while doing something else productive instead.)  Finally when I was done I had to manually edit the Makefile.PL to use the right preprocessor:

<pre><code>perl -pi -e 's!cpp"!/usr/local/Cellar/gcc47/4.7.3/bin/cpp"!' Makefile.PL
perl Makefile.PL
</code></pre>

(yeah, it'd be nice if they'd been some sort of option for that.)  Then I altered the resulting Makefile for good measure too:

<pre><code>perl -pi -e 's{CC = cc}{CC = /usr/local/Cellar/gcc47/4.7.3/bin/gcc-4.7}' Makefile
</code></pre>

And then I could build it all.

<pre><code>make
make test
</code></pre>

Of course, it still got errors.  But they're <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=88348">not new errors</a>.  So I pretend I didn't see them and install anyway.

<pre><code>make install
</code></pre>

I hate computers sometimes.
