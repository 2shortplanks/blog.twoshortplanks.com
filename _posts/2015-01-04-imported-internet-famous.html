Did I ever tell you guys the story of how I once made the front page of <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur</a> with a Perl script?

As we're all aware, imgur is a imaging sharing network traditionally dedicated to such topics as <a href="http://imgur.com/search?q=cats">funny cat photos</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/t/memes">internet memes</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/t/polandball">other recycled content</a> often direct from its sister site reddit.  It's internet fluff in the best possible way, and what I like to browse when I'm eating lunch and I need to disconnect my brain after a morning of coding.  While it's got a minority of hardcore technical members, it's not at all known for it's technical content due to posts being promoted based mostly on up and down votes given by the masses;  As far as I know I'm the only person ever to get to the front page with actual code.

So how did I end up posting code of all things to imgur? Well, like most good Internet stories it started like this:

One lunchtime I saw a front page post featuring an image claiming that <strong>startling</strong> was the only nine letter word that you could remove one letter at a time and still get a valid word (i.e. <b>starting, <b>staring, string, sting, sing, sin, in, I.</b></b>)  I was pretty sure that wasn't right and there must be others. So I did what any Perl programmer does in this situation.  I wrote a Perl program to prove that wasn't true:

And then for giggles, I posted the above image <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/yDV6s">back to imgur</a>.  Not exactly my best code, but I wrote it in about five minutes flat.  Five hours later it hit the front page and I had done my duty.
