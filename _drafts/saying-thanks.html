<p>The first thing I did when I installed the release candidate was to <em>thank</em> those people involved using the <code>perlthanks</code> utilitly, which you can just run from the command line.  This throws up a simple command line application that sends an email of gratitude.  It's essentially the same thing as <code>perlbug</code> but for saying thanks, not for reporting bugs</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre>bash$ travis-2:~ mark$ perlthanks
This program provides an easy way to send a thank-you message
back to the authors and maintainers of perl.

If you wish to submit a bug report, please run it without the -T
flag (or run the program perlbug rather than perlthanks)

First of all, please provide a subject for the message.
Subject: Thanks for all the releases


It's now time to compose your thank-you message.

Some information about your local perl configuration will
automatically be included at the end of your message, because
we're curious about the different ways that people build and use
perl. If you'd rather not share this information, you're welcome
to delete it.

You will probably want to use a text editor to enter the body of
your report. If "vi" is the editor you want to use, then just
press Enter, otherwise type in the name of the editor you would
like to use.

If you have already composed the body of your report, you may
enter "file", and /Users/mark/local/bin/perlthanks will prompt
you to enter the name of the file containing your report.

Editor [vi]: 
</pre>
<p></code><br />
<i>type thanks message here</i><br />
<code>
<pre>

You have finished composing your message. At this point, you have 
a few options. You can:

    * [Se]end the message to perl-thanks@perl.org, 
    * [D]isplay the message on the screen,
    * [R]e-edit the message
    * Display or change the message's [su]bject
    * Save the message to a [f]ile to mail at another time
    * [Q]uit without sending a message

Action (Send/Display/Edit/Subject/Save to File): Se</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>W</p>
