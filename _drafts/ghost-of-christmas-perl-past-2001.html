<p>These days the lead up to Christmas is a very busy time for me at work;  I couldn't imagine having time to write the advent calendar entries I used to write for the Perl Advent calendar anymore.  I used to stay up to the wee hours in the morning fiddling my examples.  Now I stay up to the wee hours in the morning monitoring server loads each Christmas, which is why I'm glad to have handed over the mantle to others several years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, this is Perl.  There's More Than One Way To Do It, and this year there's now more than one Perl 5 calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/">The RJBS Advent Calendar</a> - my perfect favourite, featuring tutorials how to solve simple problems with a module from CPAN.  I think this is the closest to the original idea I was going for.
 </li>
<li><a href="http://www.perladvent.org/2009/">The Perl Advent Calendar</a></li>
<p> - The 'official' Perl advent calendar, featuring my old domain name.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2009">The Catalyst Advent calendar</a> - featuring a new articles on the web framework each day
</li>
</ul>
<p>But what of the modules of yesteryear that I wrote so much about?  Do we still use them?  Are they still worthwhile?</p>
<p>This is the first post in a series of where I look back at the Perl modules I recommended back when I was doing the Perl advent calendar and see if what I recommended was any good.</p>
<h2>2001</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.perladvent.org/2001/1st/">Mail::Audit</a></dt>
<dd>This module was replaced by a suite of modules in the Email:: namespace as part of the Perl Email Project</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.perladvent.org/2001/2nd/">Mail::ListDetector</a></dt>
<dd>Not really replaced, but we've seen the simple email list fall our of popularity with the rise of the web forum and social networking sites.  Most email list software that survives these days is pretty good at using the standard header so complex tools like this aren't used as much</dd>
