<p>So, I had an occasion to try and install mod_perl with a Perlbrew created perl (opposed to the system perl as supplied by apple.)</p>
<p>It didn't work;  It failed tests rather terribly:</p>
<p>Syntax error on line 205 of /Users/Mark/.cpanm/work/1398258436.64970/mod_perl-2.0.8/t/conf/httpd.conf:<br />
Cannot load /Users/Mark/.cpanm/work/1398258436.64970/mod_perl-2.0.8/src/modules/perl/mod_perl.so into server:<br />
dlopen(/Users/Mark/.cpanm/work/1398258436.64970/mod_perl-2.0.8/src/modules/perl/mod_perl.so, 10): Symbol not found:<br />
 _modperl_handler_name</p>
<p>Which is a funny way of saying "er, when I tried to load the mod_perl.so I couldn't find the _modperl_handler_name in it".</p>
<p>I did some googling.  I read the pod inside mod_perl.  And then I had an inkling of what is going on.</p>
<p>mod_perl uses a macro MP_INLINE to prefix certain functions so that when mod_perl is compiled they can be turned into inline functions (which are faster, but not linkable) in the situations where mod_perl is, say, compiled into the httpd itself.  For some reason this was happening when mod_perl was being compiled into mod_perl.so, which resulted in the "wtf" error above.</p>
<p>So, I took a hatchet to the mod_perl source code.  And ripped out these lines from <code>src/modules/perl/modperl_common_util.h</code><br />
<code><br />
#ifdef MP_DEBUG<br />
#define MP_INLINE<br />
#else<br />
#define MP_INLINE APR_INLINE<br />
#endif<br />
</code></p>
<p>And replaced them with a simple:<br />
<code><br />
#define MP_INLINE<br />
</code></p>
