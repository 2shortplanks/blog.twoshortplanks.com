<p>Moose is wonderful, and Moose is great. But occasionally you <b>do</b> run into <em>some</em> problems.</p>
<pre><code>package ProvidesAttribute;
use Moose::Role;

has 'an_attribute' =&gt; (
    is =&gt; 'ro',
);

1;</code></pre>
<p>And let's write another role that requires that the class that consumes it has a <code>an_attribute</code> method:</p>
<pre>package NeedsAttribute;
use Moose::Role;

requires 'an_attribute';

1;</pre>
<p>And a class that consumes both of these:</p>
<pre>package Class;
use Moose;

with 'ProvidesAttribute','NeedsAttribute';

1;</pre>
<p>This should all work, right? The <code>an_attribute</code> method should be provided by the attribute declaration in <code>ProvidesAttribute</code> thus satisfying the <code>requires</code> in <code>NeedsAttribute</code>. Nope. Not with the latest version of Moose available at the time of writing (2.1403)...</p>
<pre><code>bash$ perl -e 'use Class'
'ProvidesAttribute|NeedsAttribute' requires the method 'an_attribute' to be implemented by 'Class' at /Users/Mark/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/lib/site_perl/5.18.2/darwin-2level/Moose/Exporter.pm line 419
    Moose::with('ProvidesAttribute', 'NeedsAttribute') called at Class.pm line 4
    require Class.pm at -e line 1
    main::BEGIN at Class.pm line 0
    eval {...} at Class.pm line 0
Compilation failed in require at -e line 1.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bother! The attribute isn't a method at the time the role composition requirement checking is done. However, once we know that this is a problem the fix is simple. Just pre-declare the <code>an_attribute</code> sub in <code>ProvidesAttribute</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package ProvidesAttribute;
use Moose::Role;

has 'an_attribute' =&gt; (
    is =&gt; 'ro',
);
sub an_attribute;

1;</code></pre>
<p>Despite being a little ugly, now everything works.</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, no Moo doesn't have this same issue. You could <code>s/Moose/Moo/g</code> the above code and you wouldn't need the <code>sub an_attribute;</code>. Oh well.</p>
